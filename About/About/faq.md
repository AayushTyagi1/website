## How do the Metrics help me understand whether an open source project is healthy?
CHAOSS provides standardized metrics that uniformly generate information about open source projects. You can use these metrics to see changes in your project that might indicate changes in project health. You can also use these metrics to compare your project to similiar projects. We will not offer an opinion about the health of any project but provide objective measures that can help you make an informed decision.

## Will you create a project health index?
No, open source projects work very differently and we believe that a single index will not do this diversity justice. Our approach, rather, is to provide a collection of standardized metrics that can inform your personal opinion about project health.

## What do you mean with 'implementation-agnostic metrics'?
Our goal is to define metrics independent of a specific implementation.

## What are the IP or commitments that contributing members are making to make sure that the derived IP is patent free and distributed under an open source license.
Our goal is to make our innovations available to everyone to use for free. We honor open source licenses of upstream projects. We license our own innovations under the GPLv2+ or MIT open source license. We only accept patent free contributions or where patent licenses are available for free.
