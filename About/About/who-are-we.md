## Who are we?

CHAOSS is a Linux Foundation project focused on creating analytics and metrics to help define community health. Work in the CHAOSS Project community is organized in two committees and four working groups:

### Committees

- The [Metrics Committee](https://chaoss.community/metrics) works on establishing implementation-agnostic metrics for measuring community activity, contributions, and health.

- The [Software Committee](https://chaoss.community/software) works on producing integrated, open source software for analyzing software development, and definition of standards and models used in that software in specific use cases.

### Working Groups

The goal of the working groups is to refine the metrics and to work with software implementations. The working groups are:

- [Diversity and Inclusion](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion)

- [Growth-Maturity-Decline](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd)

- [Common Metrics](https://github.com/chaoss/metrics)

- [Value](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value)

- [Risk](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-risk)
