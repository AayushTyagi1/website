## Who are we?

CHAOSS is a Linux Foundation project focused on creating analytics and metrics to help define community health. Work in the CHAOSS Project community is organized in two committees:

The [Metrics Committee](https://chaoss.community/metrics) works on establishing implementation-agnostic metrics for measuring community activity, contributions, and health.

The [Software Committee](https://chaoss.community/tools) works on producing integrated, open source software for analyzing software development, and definition of standards and models used in that software in specific use cases.
