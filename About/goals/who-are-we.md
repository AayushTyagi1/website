## Who are we?

CHAOSS is a Linux Foundation project focused on creating analytics and metrics to help define community health. Work in the CHAOSS Project community is organized in two committees:

    The [Metrics](https://chaoss.community/metrics) Committee works on establishing implementation-agnostic metrics for measuring community activity, contributions, and health.

    The [Software](https://chaoss.community/tools) Committee works on producing integrated, open source software for analyzing software development, and definition of standards and models used in that software in specific use cases.
