## About CHAOSScon

Meet the CHAOSS community and the tools used by several open source projects, communities, and engineering teams to track and analyze their development activities, communities health, diversity, etc.

This conference will show CHAOSS updates, use cases, and hands-on workshops for developers, community managers, project managers, and anyone interested in measuring open source project health.

Specific CHAOSS software highlighted will be GrimoireLab and Augur with their respective updates and demos.

We will also share insights from the CHAOSS workgroups on *Diversity and Inclusion*, *Growth-Maturity-Decline*, *Risk*, and *Value* that branched out from the CHAOSS metrics work.
