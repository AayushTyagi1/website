# How to add slides to the CHAOSScon schedule

1. Upload slides to this folder, preferably in
  PDF format (`/website/CHAOSScon/2019EU/slides/`).
2. Add to the [schedule's](../schedule.md) last column a link to the
  slides `[<filetype>](https://chaoss.github.io/website/CHAOSScon/2019EU/slides/<filename>)`.
3. Submit pull request if you don't have commit rights.

## Explanation
The `chaoss/website` repository is setup as a GitHub page.
Instead of uploading files to our WordPress installation, we link to the GitHub pages server.
