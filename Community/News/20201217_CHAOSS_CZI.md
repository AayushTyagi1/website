## By Matt Germonprez and Sean Goggins

One of the things that we are exploring in the CHAOSS project is how our open source community health efforts can prove useful in Scientific Software communities. Sean and I had a chance to present our work at the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Essential Open Source Software for Science](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/) meeting on December 9th, 2020.

***You can check out the CHAOSS/Augur presentation at the 1:26:26 mark.***
