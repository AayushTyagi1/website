One of the things that we are exloring in the CHAOSS project is how our open source community health efforts can prove useful in Scientific Software communities. 
Sean and I had a chance to present our work at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Essential Open Source Software for Science Meeting on December 9th, 2020. You can check out 
our presentation here:
