## GSoC HTML Navigation Example

USE HTML and CSS to demonstrate how navigation elements can be used to hide and show particular elements on a webpage. Create a folder and name it using your full name. Within the folder, you can create as many files as you need to demonstrate your navigation examples. This task needs to be original code written by you, not code that has been copied from other sources. If you would like to show off your examples on a live site, please create a file that has a URL link to your examples.
