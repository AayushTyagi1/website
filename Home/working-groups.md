### CHAOSS Working groups

The goal of the working groups is to refine the metrics and to work with software implementations. The workgroups are built around the four categories of metrics that CHAOSS has identified.

The working groups are:  
[Common Metrics](https://github.com/chaoss/metrics)   
[Diversity and Inclusion](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution)  
[Evolution](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd)  
[Risk](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-risk)  
[Value](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value)
