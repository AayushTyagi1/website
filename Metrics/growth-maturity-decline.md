### Growth Maturity and Decline

An OSS community has states: growth, maturity, and decline. The state that a community is in may prove important when evaluating both across and within community concerns. This Working Group focuses on Growth-Maturity-Decline metrics and software. The goal is to refine the metrics that inform Growth-Maturity-Decline and to work with software implementations.
