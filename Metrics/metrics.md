## Metrics

What are the CHAOSS Metrics?

The CHAOSS Metrics Committee defines implementation-agnostic metrics for assessing open source communities’ health and sustainability. CHAOSS goals are to establish implementation-agnostic metrics for measuring community activity, contributions, and health; and optionally produce standardized metric exchange formats, detailed use cases, models, or recommendations to analyze specific issues in the industry/OSS world. CHAOSS has identified four categories of metrics - Growth Maturity and Decline (GMD), Diversity and inclusion (D&I), Risk, and Value. The full list of Metrics are located in the CHAOSS Metrics Repository → https://github.com/chaoss/metrics.
