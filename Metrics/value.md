### Value

Economic value is expressed in different ways for different types of stakeholders. Lack of metrics makes it difficult for business decision makers to compare open-source and to allocate resources optimally across projects, slowing decision making and product innovation. The main goal is to publish trusted industry-standard Value Metrics. A kind of S&P for software development, an authoritative source for metrics significance and industry norms.
