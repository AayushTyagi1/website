### If you are new, CHAOSS Community calls are good place to start.

The first Tuesday every month is a formal 'monthly call' for updates from committees, working groups, and broader community. The agenda for monthly meetings will be posted to the mailing list.

All other Tuesdays, we 'hangout' informally without agenda. The hangout provides a permanent and regular space for discussion. Topics include new metrics, how to interpret metrics, progress on software development, new features that would be nice, recaps from recent events, or community questions.

Further, CHAOSS Working Groups meet weekly to discuss working group specific topics.

See connection information below.
