### CHAOSS Community Calls

The first Tuesday every month is a formal 'monthly call' for updates from committees, workgroups, and broader community. The agenda for monthly meetings will be posted to the mailing list.

All other Tuesdays, we 'hangout' informally without agenda. The hangout provides a permanent and regular space for discussion. Topics include new metrics, how to interpret metrics, progress on software development, new features that would be nice, recaps from recent events, or community questions.

If you are new to CHAOSS, monthly calls are good for getting an update and the weekly hangouts are good for asking your specific questions.

We meet Tuesdays from 11:00 to 12:00 (US Central Time)
