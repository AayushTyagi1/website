### CHAOSS Community Calls
The first Tuesday every month is a formal 'monthly call' for updates from committees, working groups, and broader community. All other Tuesdays, we 'hangout' informally without agenda. Topics include new metrics, how to interpret metrics, progress on software development, new features that would be nice, recaps from recent events, or community questions.

The CHAOSS community meets every Tuesday at 11am CT (usually 18:00 CET, [check your local time](http://arewemeetingyet.com/Chicago/2018-11-06/11:00/w/CHAOSS%20weekly%20meeting#eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Vub21haGEuem9vbS51cy9qLzcyMDQzMTI4OCJ9)) via [Zoom](https://unomaha.zoom.us/j/720431288) -- [Agenda and meeting minutes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PMDWc6xMe0fNE7shxTK5_HE_ykRBG5w55_Zx5hvzsEY/edit)
