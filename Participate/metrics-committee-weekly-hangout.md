### Metrics Committee Weekly Hangout

There is nothing formal with this hangout. We come and go as our schedules permit. The hangout provides a permanent and regular space for metrics discussion. Topics include new metrics, how to interpret metrics, how metrics can be related to value, or whatever else youâ€™d like to chat about.

We meet weekly on Tuesdays between 11:00 and 12:00 (US Central Time).
