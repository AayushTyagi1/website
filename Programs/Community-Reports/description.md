Thanks for your interest in generating a CHAOSS Community Report for your project. A few things that we ask: 

1) You only submit one repository from your project from which we will generate a CHAOSS Commumnity Report. This can be your project's main repository and it can be a large repository. For the time being, we are limiting the CHAOSS Community Reports to one page and submitting more than one repository will require more than one page for reporting. 

2) If you submit more than a single repository for your CHAOSS Community Report, we will simply select the first one on the list (Hint: If you would like two repositories analyzed, submit two report requests)

3) Please be patient with us as we generate your report. We are new to this and while we think we have the process pretty well worked out, we're not sure about things such as demand from others. We hope to get your reports back in a few days. We'll really do our best 

4) The report will include four different graphs 
  - Commit Dates and Times (presented in the commiters local time)
  - Number of Open and Closed Issues over Time 
  - Mean Duratation (Days) of all Closed Pull Requests 
  - Fly-by and Repeat Contributor Counts per Month
  
5) All CHAOSS Community Reports are generated with CHAOSS software (GrimoireLab/Cauldron and Augur) and are built from CHAOSS released metrics
