## Evolution
Evolution Repository: https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution

Scope: Aspects related to how the source code changes over time, and the mechanisms that the project has to perform and control those changes.

### Focus Area - Code Development

**Goal:**  
Activity - Learn about activity involved in changing (or adding) code.  
Question: How many **changes** are happening to the source code, during a certain time period?  

**Metric** | **Question** | **Comment**
---|---|---
[Code Changes](https://chaoss.community/metric-code-changes/) | What are the number of changes to the source code? | [Link](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/issues/181)
[Code Changes Lines](https://chaoss.community/metric-code-changes-lines) | what are the aggregated number of lines touched in all changes? | [Link](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/issues/182)
