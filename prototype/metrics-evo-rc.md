Scope: Aspects related to how the source code changes over time, and the mechanisms that the project has to perform and control those changes.

### Focus Area - Code Development

**Goal:**  
Activity - Learn about activity involved in changing (or adding) code.  
Question: How many **changes** are happening to the source code, during a certain time period?

  <tr><td><a href="https://chaoss.community/metric-code-changes-lines">Code Changes Lines</a></td><td>What are the aggregated number of lines touched in all changes?</td></tr>
</tbody>

Question: How many **reviews** to proposed changes to the source code are happening during a certain time period?  

<div>
<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Question</th></tr></thead>

  <tr><td><a href="https://chaoss.community/metric-reviews">Reviews</a></td><td>What are the number of new review requests for changes to the source code?</td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="https://chaoss.community/metric-reviews-accepted">Reviews Accepted</a></td><td>How many reviews result in accepting the code change?</td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="https://chaoss.community/metric-reviews-declined">Reviews Declined</a></td><td>What are the number of reviews for changes to the source code that ended declining the change?</td></tr>

**Goal:**  
Efficiency - Learn how effective new code is merged into the code base.  
Question: How efficient is the project in **reviewing** proposed changes to the code, during a certain time period?
